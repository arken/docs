# Signing up for GitHub

In order to create a submission for the [Core Arken Cluster](https://github.com/arken/core-manifest) you must have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/signup) or create one first.

Having the Core Manifest on GitHub allows us to accept submissions from the community while also being easily audible and reasonably secure.
