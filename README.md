### What is Arken?
Arken is a distributed storage system built to archive important open source and scientific data. Instead of requiring a central server, Arken is made up of many distributed computers all working together. These computers pool their individual resources to form a shared global storage cluster. Taking advantage of many small computers, Arken has a cheaper entry cost per node than many traditional storage systems. For example, a member of the Arken cluster can be made up of almost any computer with available storage space -- including a $35 Raspberry Pi.
